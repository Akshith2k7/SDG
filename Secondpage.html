                <p><h1> Goal 1</h1><br>
                 Goal 1 of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals aims to eradicate extreme poverty globally. The goal specifically 
                targets reducing the proportion of people living in extreme poverty. It also encompasses a broader agenda of ensuring social 
                protection systems, access to basic services, and resilience against economic, social, and environmental shocks for all 
                individuals. By addressing the root causes of poverty, such as lack of access to education, healthcare, clean water, and 
                opportunities for decent work, Goal 1 seeks to create a more equitable and sustainable world where everyone has the change to 
                thrive.

                <h1>Goal 2</h1><br>
                <p> Goal 2 is about creating a world free of hunger by 2030.The global issue of hunger and food insecurity has shown an alarming increase since 2015, a trend exacerbated by a combination of factors including the pandemic, conflict, climate change, and deepening inequalities.
                    By 2022, approximately 735 million people – or 9.2% of the world’s population – found themselves in a state of chronic hunger – a staggering rise compared to 2019. This data underscores the severity of the situation, revealing a growing crisis.
                    In addition, an estimated 2.4 billion people faced moderate to severe food insecurity in 2022. This classification signifies their lack of access to sufficient nourishment. This number escalated by an alarming 391 million people compared to 2019.
                    The persistent surge in hunger and food insecurity, fueled by a complex interplay of factors, demands immediate attention and coordinated global efforts to alleviate this critical humanitarian challenge.
                    Extreme hunger and malnutrition remains a barrier to sustainable development and creates a trap from which people cannot easily escape. Hunger and malnutrition mean less productive individuals, who are more prone to disease and thus often unable to earn more and improve their livelihoods.
                    2 billion people in the world do not have reg- ular access to safe, nutritious and sufficient food. In 2022, 148 million children had stunted growth and 45 million children under the age of 5 were affected by wasting.
